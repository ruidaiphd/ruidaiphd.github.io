Hello, I am a senior research director at <a href='https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/'> Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS)</a> at the University of Pennsylvania and an adjunct research professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen).

During the summer, I teach a Ph.D.-level course on empirical asset pricing and an introductory course on financial data analysis to finance and data science majors. I do research for my professional interest, specifically in Machine Learning and Environmental, Social, and Governance topics. Occasionally, I provide faculty and doctoral students with training on research databases and tools.


I created this site to expand my teaching materials and to house Juyterlab codes. I would likely update <a href='https://www.ruidaiwrds.info/'>my Google Site </a> more often for my research papers and profile information.
