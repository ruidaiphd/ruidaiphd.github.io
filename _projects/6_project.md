<a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-405X(93)90023-5'> Fama and French (1993) is the cornerstone of modern asset pricing research, and it has been embraced by a large number of practitioners for making investment decisions. I created a simple Python replication using CRSP and Compustat data through WRDS for teaching purpose. Please click the <img src="/assets/img/colab.svg"> button below for a interactive note.
